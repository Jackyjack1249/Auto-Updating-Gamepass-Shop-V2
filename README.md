Customisation:

For the Template, you need a single Frame to work with. Name it "Frame"
Inside that Frame you need at least these 4 things.

A Button of some sort named "BuyButton" which has a Number Value inside it called "GamepassId"
An Image Label named "Image"
A Text Label named "Price"

For the Shop, you don't need anything other than a ScreenGui named "Shop" a Frame named "Frame" inside of that and then a ScrollingFrame.
The scrolling frame must be named "ScrollingFrame"
